 * Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase . You will keep purchasing phones(hint : loop !) until you run out of money in your bank account . You 'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.
 * 
 * After you' ve calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted .
 * 
 * Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not .
 * 
 * You should set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "spending threshold,"  as well as a variable for your "bank account balance." "
 * 
 * You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a " $ " and rounding to two decimal places.
